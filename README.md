## Introduction
This project is part of the x86-64 assembly module. It aims to lead student to a better understanding of what exactly is assembly and how registers work. It's also an introduction to a low-level programming language.

Although this project was short, it was great to learn more about these topics. I personnally enjoyed it but wish I did the syscall function.
